# Pocket Core Api Documentation
A web front end for the Pocket Core API that is loaded dynamically.

## Welcome to Pocket Core MVP Docs
This simple API guide is an easy to use reference for Pocket Core (MVP). Pocket Core's API may be designed differently then API's you have seen before. It is a blend between a RESTful and a JSON RPC architecture. Using the guide below, it should be very apparent how to access the API from each endpoint.

Just a tip: this guide is simply a front end to a series of already exposed GET requests. So if you're running a PC instance, just go to localhost:port/v1/routes to see all the possible routes and visit each route through your browser to see a local JSON version of this guide!

## Purpose
Currently only purposed for internal use only. The purpose of this simple app is to provide an easy to read interface for new developers developing projects that interact with PC API.
